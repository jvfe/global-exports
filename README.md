# Global export network

A project in which I analyse and visualize the global network of exports. 

It's available both in [Observable](https://observablehq.com/d/d6f9f7aecfedff39) and, although in lower quality, as a 
[github page](https://jvfe.github.io/global-exports/).

It was made mostly as a way to get me to use DVC and networkx.
